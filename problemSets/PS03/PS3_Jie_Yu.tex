\section*{Question 5}

				Residual standard error: 0.07339 on 3190 degrees of freedom
				Multiple R-squared:  0.4496,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.4493 
				F-statistic:  1303 on 2 and 3190 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
				
				According to the results, the F statistic is 1303, 
				the degrees of freedom are 2 and 3190, 
				and the p-value is less than 2.2e-16, 
				indicating that there is greater credibility to reject the null hypothesis.
				In summary, the model suggests a significant relationship 
				between voteshare, difflog, and presvote. 
				The R-squared values indicate that the model explains 
				a substantial proportion of the variance in voteshare.

		\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?
		\begin{footnotesize}
			\begin{verbatim}
				In both instances, the coefficient for the variable of interest
				 (presvote in Question 4 and residuals2 in the recent regression) 
				 coincidentally appears to be approximately 0.2569. 
				 The associated t-values are both 21.84, 
				 and both exhibit highly significant p-values (<2e-16).
				 This similarity might be a statistical coincidence or could suggest 
				 that the variable residuals2 has a comparable impact 
				 on the dependent variable (voteshare in Question 4 and residuals1 in the recent regression).
				 While investigating further, it is essential to consider
				 whether there is a theoretical or logical explanation 
				 for this observed similarity. 
				 Additionally, careful scrutiny of the model setup 
				 and data appropriateness is crucial. If the relationship 
				 between residuals2 and the dependent variable 
				 is unexpected from a theoretical standpoint, 
				 it may warrant a closer examination to ensure 
				 the robustness of the analysis and rule out potential data issues.
