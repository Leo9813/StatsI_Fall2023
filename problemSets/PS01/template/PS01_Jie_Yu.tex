	\section*{Question 1 (40 points): Education}

A school counselor was curious about the average of IQ of the students in her school and took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set:\\
\vspace{.5cm}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find a 90\% confidence interval for the average student IQ in the school.\\

	  \begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Result}:\\
		 93.95993  102.9201\\
		 attr(,"conf.level")\\
		 0.9\\
		
       \end{itemize}
	\item Next, the school counselor was curious  whether  the average student IQ in her school is higher than the average IQ score (100) among all the schools in the country.\\ 
	\noindent Using the same sample, conduct the appropriate hypothesis test with$\alpha=0.05$.
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=45, lastline=52]{PS01_Jie_Yu.R} 
		\begin{itemize}
	      \item \textbf{Result:}\\
	      Test Statistic (t): 37.59297 \\
	      Degrees of Freedom: 24 \\
	      p-value: 7.636596e-23 \\
		  At a significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.\\
		  There is enough evidence to conclude that school students' average IQ is higher than the national average.

	\section*{Question 2 (40 points): Political Economy}

\noindent Researchers are curious about what affects the amount of money communities spend on addressing homelessness. The following variables constitute our data set about social welfare expenditures in the USA. \\
\vspace{.5cm}


\begin{tabular}{r|l}
	\texttt{State} &\emph{50 states in US} \\
	\texttt{Y} & \emph{per capita expenditure on shelters/housing assistance in state}\\
	\texttt{X1} &\emph{per capita personal income in state} \\
	\texttt{X2} &  \emph{Number of residents per 100,000 that are "financially insecure" in state}\\
	\texttt{X3} &  \emph{Number of people per thousand residing in urban areas in state} \\
	\texttt{Region} &  \emph{1=Northeast, 2= North Central, 3= South, 4=West} \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent Explore the \texttt{expenditure} data set and import data into \texttt{R}.

\vspace{.5cm}
\begin{itemize}

\item
Please plot the relationships among \emph{Y}, \emph{X1}, \emph{X2}, and \emph{X3}? What are the correlations among them (you just need to describe the graph and the relationships among them)?
\vspace{.5cm}

\end{figure}

		\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Result:}
	\item  Correlation between Y and X1: Positive correlation, indicating that as X1 increases, Y tends to increase.
	\item Correlation between Y and X2: A weaker positive correlation compared to X1, indicating some positive relationship.
	\item Correlation between Y and X3: There appears to be a relatively weaker correlation between Y and X3, which is less linear than the other relationships.\\

\end{itemize}
\item
Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{Region}? On average, which region has the highest per capita expenditure on housing assistance?

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Result:}
	\item  West has thehighest per capita expenditure on housing assistance.\\

\end{itemize}
\item
Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{X1}? Describe this graph and the relationship. Reproduce the above graph including one more variable \emph{Region} and display different regions with different types of symbols and colors.

\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{ Result:}
	\item The positive correlation between Per Capita Income Per and Capita Expenditure in the South District, North District and Northwest District is stronger than that in the West District.
