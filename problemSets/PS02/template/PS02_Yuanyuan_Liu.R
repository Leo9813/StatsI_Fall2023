#For data with positive standardized residuals, which indicates that the observed frequency is higher than the predetermined frequency, positive residual standard deviations indicate that police are more likely to obtain tickets from these drivers. For data with negative standardized residuals, this means that the observed frequency is lower than the predetermined frequency, in which case a negative residual means that the police are less likely to obtain tickets from these drivers. Based on the above data, the social class of drivers may have an impact on bribery behavior between police and drivers. Police are more likely to demand bribes from drivers of higher social class.

#On the confidence interval of 0.05, we can reject H0, the reservation policy has a significant effect on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.
